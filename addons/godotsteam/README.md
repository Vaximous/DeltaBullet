Compatibility
---
While rare, sometimes Steamworks SDK updates will break compatilibity with older GodotSteam versions. Any compatability breaks are noted below.  Newer API files (dll, so, dylib) _should_ still work for older versions.

Steamworks SDK Version | GodotSteam Version
---|---
1.59 or newer | 4.6 or newer
1.58a or older | 4.5.4 or older

Versions of GodotSteam that have compatibility breaks introduced.

GodotSteam Version | Broken Compatibility
---|---
4.8 | Networking identity system removed, replaced with Steam IDs
4.9 | sendMessages returns an Array
4.11 | setLeaderboardDetailsMax removed

Known Issues
---
- GDExtension for 4.1 is **not** compatible with 4.0.3 or lower. Please check the versions you are using.
- Overlay will not work in the editor but will work in export projects when uploaded to Steam.  This seems to a limitation with Vulkan currently.
- When self-compiling, **do not** use MinGW as it will cause crashes.

Quick How-To
---
For complete instructions on how to build the GDExtension version of GodotSteam, [please refer to our documentation's 'How-To GDExtension' section.](https://godotsteam.com/howto/gdextension/) It will have the most up-to-date information.

Alternatively, you can just [download the pre-compiled versions in our Releases section](https://github.com/GodotSteam/GodotSteam/releases) or [from the Godot Asset Library](https://godotengine.org/asset-library/asset/2445) and skip compiling it yourself!

[To start, check out our tutorial on initializing Steam.](https://godotsteam.com/tutorials/initializing/)  There are additional tutorials with more in the works.  You can also [check out additional Godot and Steam related videos, text, additional tools, plug-ins, etc. here.](https://godotsteam.com/tutorials/external/)

Usage
---
Do not use the GDExtension version of GodotSteam with any of the module versions whether it be our pre-compiled versions or ones you compile.  They are not compatible with each other.

When exporting with the GDExtension version, please use the normal Godot Engine templates instead of our GodotSteam templates or you will have a lot of issues.
