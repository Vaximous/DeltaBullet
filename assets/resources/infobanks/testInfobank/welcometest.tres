Currently, there are only a couple of options. Most entities like the world map and whatnot are unfinished as fuck, if you're seeing this. Then congrats, seems like the dev created an info slide! Regardless, there isn't a way of getting clothes without editing saves directly. Purchasing property and weapons exist but theres not a way to earn [b][color=blue]Grit[/color][/b] through contracts, of which there are only two (Debug Street & Active Ragdoll Test).

Enjoy what little combat there is, feedback is appreciated and will be considered.

P.S: [b]To my other badass developer, don't make fun of me for this, I'll whoop your ass.[/b]"
